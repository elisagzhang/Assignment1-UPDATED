# *Evaluation of 10 Heuristics*
## Visibility of System Status
- on the front page, there is a slideshow/scroll feature but the buttons don't indicate that you can click them to scroll through. this hides a lot of the features the website offers (3)
- same with the features, no indication that it is a clickable link (2)
- this also happens with other buttons sporadically throughout the site, which is confusing because it doesn't seem to follow a pattern or have a reason for this (2)
- top bar change colors/highlighted when hovered over
- provides login failure feedback and password strength

## Match Between System and the Real World
- the website provides suggestions on what to search but they are vague and can be confusing, especially to users who aren't as experienced in the medical field (2)
- sometimes, it isn't clear where the link you click will lead you. for example, I clicked a link/logo expecting to be lead to an external site, but it was actually just another page on the website (1)
- why is the log out button a tab? (1)

## User Control and Freedom
- the website logo is always on the top left, so it provides easy navigation back to the homepage
- website, so browser back/foward buttons allow easy navigation
- try another search options availible but it is not a streamlined and easy process (1)

## Consistency and Standards
- sometimes i think i'm clicking on a tab, but i'm brought to a completely different page, formatting is not consistent (3)
- after doing a search, the first results are actually advertisements? which is confusing because they are formatted very similarily to the actual relavant results (3)
- for a lot of the features, there are multiple pathways to get to them but it is confusing because they are label slightly differently, cannot tell that they are the same features (2)
- there are two different ways to log in on the same page (1)
- top bar/header not always consistent (1)
- the top bar tabs and just general formatting don't seem to follow the site map flow so nagivation is really confusing (3)

## Error Prevention
- checks for incorrect password
- checks that password meets requirements
- there is no op-

## Recognition Rather than Recall
- real time suggestions provided for the search bar
- does provide suggestions and topics of interest but it is hard to navigate due to poor formatting (1)

## Flexibility and efficiency of use
- the page provides a lot of information, but not everyone needs all this information. it would be better if the page was more user friendly to people who don't want to see a lot, or don't know how to navigate through the dense amount of information (2)
- it also feels like you are expected to know a lot of medical terminology, not beginner friendly (2)
- website generally needs to be much more streamlined to find specific information, instead of just throwing a lot of information all at once and expecting the user to comb through and find what they need (3)
  
## Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- formatting seems to often been a long continous scroll of information, hard to find specific things (3)
- on the front page, there are too many redundant links/roll down menus, too busy for no reason (2)
- front page has too much stuff (3)
- everything kind of blends together, there is no effort to make more important/relavant information stand out and be seen first (2)
- clicking the account tab and hovering to click "account settings" leads to the SAME page? waste of space (1)

## Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- provides error page and suggestions for bad search terms 
- does not distinguish if username or password is wrong when trying to login (1)
- again, why is the log out button a tab? i clicked it thinking that it was another page and i was immediately logged out (2)

## Help and documentation
- the main site is essentially one big help page, but it doesn't feel streamlined and is hard to nagivate (2)
- there is a search bar and a help center
- but help center seems to be less about the website and more about generally asked health questions and links to other medical resources, website help section seems like a second thought (3)

# *Overall Evaluation of Website*
I think that this website is trying to provide a lot of relavant and important information. However, they haven't figured out how to present this information in a organized way. The way the website is set up, they don't have the capacity to accurately present all this information and it just seems like they are being too overambitious and hasty. It is as if everytime they thought of a new feature, they just found some random space on the homepage and shoved it in. So everything is just all over the place. Also, I don't really seen a huge benefit to creating an account. If you are just looking for drug information, it seems like you can do the same things sans account.
