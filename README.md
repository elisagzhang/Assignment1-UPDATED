# *Evaluation of 10 Heuristics*
## Visibility of System Status
- system provides loading feedback when uploading files into the portal
- top bar and side bar buttons change colors/underlined when hover overed
- provides status of forms filled and appointments made

## Match Between System and the Real World
- when making appointments in the portal, the use of compicated medical terminology made it confusing to choose the correct reason for the appointment (3)
- the "How do I" downbar is essentially a FAQ but it isn't immediately obvious (1)

## User Control and Freedom
- there is no back button for navigating through appointments, the cancel button immediately brings you back to the main page of the portal (3)
- portal provides opportunities to make, cancel, and reschedule appointments

## Consistency and Standards
- some pages use the same font colors to denote words to emphasize but also as headings (1)
- the way information is provided is inconsistent because sometimes it is an image with colors and words, and other times it is a big block of text (2)
- font sizes for sister pages inconsistent (1)
- method of emphasizing information inconsistent and confusing, could be red, bold, blue, larger font, etc (2)
- there are two different ways to log out of the portal on the same page (1)

## Error Prevention
- cannot check for correct document upload, it is possible to upload a completely unrelated image/document (2)

## Recognition Rather than Recall
- adding real time suggestions to the search bar would aid in helping students find answers easier (1)

## Flexibility and efficiency of use
- the page provides a lot of information, but not everyone needs all this information. it would be better if the page was more user friendly to people who don't want to see a lot, or don't know how to navigate through the dense amount of information (2)
  
## Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- each page has a lot of block text that is very close together, makes the page very busy and confusing, would be better if there was less text or if there was more space between the text (2)
- a lot of notices and unnecessary graphics (1)
- in general, everything on the page just seems very close together and it seems like they were trying to cram as much information into one page. this makes me feel very anxious, which isn't what I would want to feel when I am trying to find health information and health care (2)
- there is a roll down tab on the top of the portal but the only option is to log out, seems like a waste and unnecessary (1)

## Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- provides error page for bad search terms
- one thing I found extremely frustrating was that the portal would automatically sign you out after a few moments of inactivity. I would keep having to log back in. I think a warning page would be helpful (2)

## Help and documentation
- the main site is essentially one big help page, but it doesn't feel streamlined and is hard to nagivate (2)
- there is a search bar and kind of a FAQ 
- there is no help page in the portal. navigating the portal can require information from the website, which can be hard to remember (2)
